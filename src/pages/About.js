                        My name is Zachary White. I am currently enrolled in Bottega University as a student, studying Full Stack development.
                        My goal after graduation is to start a career in software development. Compared to what I did previously 
                        for work, I plan on pushing forward and sticking with software development since its a field where I can 
                        massively improve my knowledge of technology.
                        
                        My previous background of work is completely different from what I am studying now. I did serve in the 
                        military as a U.S. Army soldier, which helped to inspire me to do something better than combat arms 
                        related lines of work. After the Army, I went on to do multiple jobs to help ends meet. From jobs like 
                        warehousing to housekeeping, Software development will be a huge upgrade to what I used to do as 'odd jobs'.

                        As a software developer, I plan on continuing to grow as a person who loves 
                        operating technology and creating programs for it.
